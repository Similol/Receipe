    <h2>Ready??</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>First of all, wash your hands, mortar and pestle.</li>
        <li>Peel the yam, and slice into small-medium cubes, place in a pot with just enough water(and a bit more) <br>
             and leave to boil for 15-25 minutes, depending on the yam</li>
        <li>Carefully wash your tomatoes, pepper and onions(measuremnts depends on you, **wink) <br>
             and blend to a smooth puree. 
            <br> Don't forget to slice some onions down.
        </li>
        <li>Get  clean saucepan, place on fire and pour a spoon or two of palm oil(depends on you)</li>
        <li>Let it heat a little. Add your sliced onions and stir, then add your already blended pepper.</li>
        <li>Add your Iru, and let it simmer for a minute. Don't forget to keep stiring.</li>
        <li>Add your meatstock, smoked fish, beef tripes and crayfish.</li>
        <li>Let it simmer till the sauce is very well fried</li>
        <li>Add your spinach leaves, don't forget to stir it properly (**Take in all that beauty hehe).</li>
        <li>Don't overcook your vegetables, a minute or to is enough for your vegetables to get steamed the right way.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Almost done...</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>After 15-25 minutes, like I wrote up there, Place your mortar in a very secure and safe spot. </li>
        <li>Remove the pieces of yam but do not throw away the water.</li>
        <li>Now boil water in your kettle(we will need it.)</li>
        <li>Place a few pieces of Yam and start Pounding. Pounded Yam might be stressful <br>
        but the trick is to make sure every hit counts, so you dont have to pound for too long.</li>
        <li>Keep putting few pieces in and pound. Don't overcrowd your mortar to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>By now, your pounded yam has become more sticky, which mean you are right on track.</li>
        <li>Brace up and keep pounding, wash your hands thoroughly if you want check if there are lumps.</li>
        <li>Now, get the water you kept from the yam andpour it gently into your mortar
            <br>Use your pestle to gently(emphasis on gently) hit the pounded yam. <br>
            (I like to call it folding method).
        </li>
        <li>When the water gets all absorbed, hit it a few times again. Wash your hands and check the texture, It should be sticky and
            about to be elastic(this is where the boiling water comes in).
        </li>
        <li>Get your boiling water and pour gently into the mortar. <br>
             Pour just a little so your pounded yam doesn't become too soft.
        </li>
        <li>Again, gently use your pestle to hit it so it can absorb the water and become elastic.</li>
        <li>Pound it a litlle, till you are satisfied</li>
        <li>Get your scooping spoon and dish in a plate</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Pounded Yam is enjoyed best hot with efo riro and cold palm wine, 
        (**You know, a little something something) <br> Don't forget to write to me about your experience. Have a wonderful day.
